Implementation of Software Configuration Management in a Hospital Management System
📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a case study report on the implementation of Software Configuration Management (SCM) in a Hospital Management System (HMS). The report explains how structured SCM practices were applied to manage software versions, builds, releases, and changes during the system’s evolution from early development to a stable production version.

This work is submitted as part of the Software Engineering Laboratory (22IS43) curriculum.

🎯 Objectives

To understand the importance of Software Configuration Management

To study version control in a real-world HMS project

To analyze the role of build management, release management, and change management

To highlight how SCM improves system stability, traceability, and reliability

🏥 Case Study Description

The Hospital Management System initially started as a basic prototype with limited functionality. As the system expanded, managing multiple versions became challenging. By adopting SCM practices, the development team was able to:

Control software versions effectively

Reduce errors and rework

Ensure smooth transitions between development, testing, and production environments

🧩 Key SCM Components Covered

Version Control
Management of major, minor, and patch versions with proper documentation.

Build Management
Standardized and repeatable build process using automated scripts.

Release Management
Planned releases with testing, user acceptance, rollback strategies, and release notes.

Change Management
Formal change request process with impact analysis, approval, implementation, and traceability.

🧪 Outcome of the Study

Reduced system failures

Improved software stability

Faster testing and deployment cycles

Better confidence among hospital staff

Long-term maintainability and traceability of the HMS

📝 Conclusion

This case study demonstrates that effective Software Configuration Management is essential for developing and maintaining complex systems like a Hospital Management System. The structured use of version control, build, release, and change management ensured safe software evolution without disrupting critical hospital services.
